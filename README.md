# Linear-Regression-using-Keras

Here, in this we use Linear Regression to predict house prices.

Installations:
     
          Python 3.6
          
Packages to be installed:
      
              pip install numpy
              pip install pandas
              pip install matplotlib
              
  For python 3.6, to install keras first we have to install tensorflow.
  Make sure to install tensorflow before installing keras.
  
               pip install tensorflow==2.0.0
               and then,
               pip install keras==2.2.4
               
   NOTE:  If u encountered problems like this, 
           
           TensorFlow 2.1 import 'DLL load failed error' #36665 Closed
           DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found. #36683 Closed
           ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found. #36702
 
   Make sure to install these,
           
           1. Go to https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads
           2. Then download x64: vc_redist.x64.exe
           3. And install it.

   It works.
          
  Okay!!! These are the installations we require to start this project. Hope this helps you guys.
    
  In files section, Iam pinning you the dataset required and linear regression using keras material. Feel free to have it.
    
  Happy learning!!
